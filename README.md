# GiveawayTest

Develop a basic app in Swift, SwiftUI, or React Native that:
Utilizes GoHighLevel’s Contacts API on a Mock, or Live, Server.
(https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/e957726e8625d-contacts-api)

Gets the contacts utilizing the Mock, or Live, Server.
(Check the bottom of the dark blue box.)
(https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00c5ff21f0030-get-contact)

Has a label showing how many contacts you received in the GET request.
Implements different filters to check against such as:
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, and Instagram Handle(just utilize “name” for the Instagram Handle placeholder.) With this Mock Server, I am assuming all fields are filled out so please have a filter placeholder to check against all First Name’s with the letter R. Or whichever letter you input to check against.
Has a label to show how many have passed the filter requirements.
Picks a random winner from the filtered pool whenever you tap a button where it will display the Instagram Handle(“name”)
And locks some filters behind a paywall.
Utilizing Apple’s “In-App Purchases” (https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/)
OR Stripe (Use “test mode” https://docs.stripe.com/keys)

Here is a simple design example:

You can design it however you’d like. Just as long as the concept functions as intended.
